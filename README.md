Just like the old Windows game - Click on tiles to reveal what's under that tile as well as surrounding tiles. Perimeter tiles show how many mines surround that tile. Right click to plant a flag, or click again on an unrevealed tile to continue.

Practice point: The recursive function required to set the perimeter of tiles adjacent to at least one mine.
